      <h1>How God of War Transcends Video Game Story Telling</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="article-content">
      <p>God of War's most recent entry was a fantastic starting point for someone who had never, ever played a God of War game before. Historically, I've never been one for the third-person hack'n'slash, but when 2018's God of War released, I was convinced I had to play it. I'd always been enamored with a story, and I could tell from the limited footage I allowed myself to watch that I would eventually have to play Sony's latest release of its long-running IP.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Let's get the easy stuff out of the way. God of War's combat is simply meaty. You've got light and heavy attacks which can be chained together into combos, a combat loop that is familiar to anyone who has played a third-person action/adventure game before. But where God of War shines is in how it lets the player customize those combos. </p><br>
      <p> Long gone are the times of remebering complicated sequences of different attacks. Instead, players can choose from two special attacks bound to a simple one two combination of bumper or trigger presses. These special attacks are upgradable using a pool of experience, adding depth and power to these skills. The attacks are switchable, meaning they can be subbed out at any time depending on player preference and types of enemies faced.</p><br>
      <p>God of War's crafting system is completely optional and not terribly in-depth, but it provides enough of a boost to interact with it. Materials are gathered during the usual pace of play, meaning that there's never any </p>
      <p>As someone who has always had a strained relationship with my parents, God of War's story immediately spoke to me. A father, struggling with his own demons, sets out to honor his wife alongside a son he wrestles to identify with. But while the threads God of War explores (a father's desire for a son to rise above the father's mistakes, for example) are eponymous with the struggles that most (if not all) father/son relationships face, Sony Santa Monica deftly wrapped a coming-of-age story with some of the most compelling gameplay I've experienced in years.</p>
